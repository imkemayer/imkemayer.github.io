# Introduction

In October 2018 I have started a position as PhD student in statistics and applied maths at EHESS and École Polytechnique under the supervision of <a href="http://www.lps.ens.fr/~nadal/" target="_blank">Jean-Pierre Nadal</a> and <a href="http://juliejosse.com" target="_blank">Julie Josse</a>. In 2020 I have been named a <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-2020-google-phd-fellows.html" target="_blank">Google PhD Fellow</a> in Machine Learning. My current research focuses on the analysis of heterogeneous data with missing values and on causal inference with missing values. I develop methods and models which will be applied on a French database on severely traumatized patients, <a href="http://www.traumabase.eu/en_US" target="_blank">Traumabase®</a>, to help answer questions related to traumatic brain injury. For this project I work closely with the anaesthesists <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tobias_Gauss" target="_blank">Tobias Gauss</a> and Jean-Denis Moyer, members of the Traumabase® Group, together in the <a href="https://www.traumatrix.fr/" target="_blank">TrauMatrix project</a>.

Have a look at the activities of our <a href="https://misscausal.gitlabpages.inria.fr/misscausal.gitlab.io/index.html" target="_blank">causal inference and missing values group</a> at Inria.
