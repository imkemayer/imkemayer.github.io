<i>We would be delighted to count you among the participants and contributors, the objective is to try to bring together various profiles (theory, practice, machine learning, statistics, applied fields) interested in missing data.

</br>
Feel free to pass on information, submit contributions (The <b>deadline for submissions is May 20 2020</b>), transfer to your students, colleagues, etc, also inform us (main contact: <a href="http://juliejosse.com" target="_blank">Julie Josse</a>) if you would be interested in seeing a particular topic discussed in a panel session (or to participate in a panel session). The idea is really to have a day with the most scientific exchanges of sharing practices, questions, etc...
