We're pleased to share with you all the upcoming virtual workshop <b>Leveraging Observational Data with Machine Learning</b> taking place on June 22nd and 23rd, from 2 PM - 7 PM (UTC+2). Inria, Owkin, and Université de Paris have teamed up to bring you this workshop to bring together main actors working with observational or real-world data, and developing biostatistics and machine learning models for causal inference, as well as other novel approaches for integrating observational and real-world data into randomized control trials (RCTs).
