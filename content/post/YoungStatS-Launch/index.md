<p>The YoungStatS Blog is set up to promote research in statistics in its broadest
sense, encompassing all of its areas and applications, among other mathematical
statistics and probability, official statistics, biostatistics and medical
statistics, social statistics, economic statistics and econometrics,
environmental statistics, statistics in natural sciences, data science and
survey methods. The intended audiences are in particular young researchers and
scholars in statistics, but also research community in statistics in general,
practitioners in the field, advisory councils, institutions, academia, the
private sector as well as journalists. The blog is hosted by Young Statisticians
Europe and its contributors are independent researchers. Their expressed
opinions in the blog posts do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Young
Statisticians Europe or FENStatS.</p>
<p>Please check our <a href="https://youngstats.github.io/about/">home page</a> for the list of our post and the <a href="https://youngstats.github.io/categories/webinars/">webinar page</a> for the complete list of webinars.</p>

<p><strong>Submissions</strong></p>
<p>The columns appearing on the YoungStatS Blog are commissioned by the managing
editors. Academics who are interested in writing a blog-post based on their
statistical research are encouraged to send a few lines describing the possible
column and its research basis to info(at)youngstatsblog.eu. The submission
should include information on the author(s)’ current and past affiliation(s),
relevant degrees or experiences, and the URL of the author(s)’ current webpage.</p>
