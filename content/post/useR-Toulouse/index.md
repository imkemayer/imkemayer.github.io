As a member of the Forwards initiative I am happy to have been part of the Diversity committee who awarded the diversity scholarship to 25 great R community members from underrepresented or historically marginalized groups who may not have been able to attend the conference for financial reasons. 

To meet and discuss with the diversity scholars and many other useR! newbies, with conference buddies and other Forwards members and to learn more about the Forwards initiative, stop by the Forwards session at useR! 2019 in Toulouse:

- Time: Monday, July 8th, 4pm-7pm.
- Location: Pierre Baudis Conference center, Cassiop√©e room (1st floor). 
- Program: There will be a social time 4-6 pm, followed by an hour of short talks.
